Java access modifiers are keywords that determine the accessibility or scope of a class, constructor, method, or field. They play a crucial role in encapsulation, one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Java has four primary access modifiers:

1. Public: The public modifier makes a class, method, constructor, or field accessible from any other class. This is the most permissive access level. Use it when you need to expose elements widely across different packages.


   public class MyClass {
       public void myMethod() {
           // accessible from anywhere
       }
   }


2. Protected: The protected modifier allows access within the same package and subclasses. It's less restrictive than default (package-private) but more restrictive than public. Use it for methods and fields that should be inherited but not exposed widely.

   java
   protected void myProtectedMethod() {
       // accessible within the same package and subclasses
   }

3. Default (Package-Private): When no access modifier is specified, Java uses the default access level. It allows access only within the same package. This is useful for encapsulating package-specific logic without exposing it to the rest of the application.

   java
   void myDefaultMethod() {
       // accessible only within the same package
   }
  

4. Private: The private modifier restricts access to the defining class only. It's the most restrictive access level, ideal for hiding implementation details and enforcing encapsulation.

   java
   private void myPrivateMethod() {
       // accessible only within this class
   }
   

Understanding and using these access modifiers effectively helps in designing robust, maintainable, and secure Java applications.
